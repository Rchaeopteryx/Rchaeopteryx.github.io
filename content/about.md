title: What's an Rchaeopteryx?

# Hello world!

My name is Marco and I am an _**R**chaeopteryx_:
Inside, I'm still the curious little boy who, in the early 80s, when I wasn't wandering through the most beautiful landscapes of East Germany with my grandparents, always stuck my nose into animal books (especially about dinosaurs); outside I am now a no less curious man in his prime who sits far too much in front of the computer and would much rather live with a dog in a trailer at the edge of the forest than without a dog in the middle of Berlin. So all in all, I'm kind of a _nerdy outdoorsman_.

Interests and studies ... (coming soon)

On this website I would like to ... (coming soon)

Have fun on my page!
